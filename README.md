CryptoFlow Investigator: Django Project CryptoFlow Investigator is a Django-based web application designed for investigating cryptocurrency flows, particularly focusing on Ethereum transactions. The project integrates machine learning models to detect illegal accounts from ongoing Ethereum transactions in its mempool. It provides a comprehensive platform for analyzing and visualizing transaction data to identify suspicious activities. Features: Machine Learning Models: Utilizes machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, DNN Keras Classifier, and Ensemble Learning techniques such as Voting Classifier and Stacking Classifier to detect illegal transactions. Data Collection: Collects addresses associated with illegal and legal transactions from various sources and extracts 22 features corresponding to these addresses. These features include transaction types, time taken for transactions, average, minimum, and maximum values, ERC20 transaction values over time, etc. Data Visualization: Provides visualization tools to gain insights into the dataset, showcasing how each feature contributes to identifying illegal and legal transactions. Visualizations aid in understanding patterns and anomalies in cryptocurrency flows. User Interface: Offers an intuitive web interface for users to interact with the application, upload datasets, train machine learning models, and analyze transaction data. Security: Implements security measures to protect sensitive information and ensure secure access to the application.
